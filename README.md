## Overview
These are my solutions for the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) roadmap, implemented in **TypeScript**.

My goal for this repository is to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) patterns, focusing on code quality, type safety, and runtime efficiency.

## Tech Stack & Environment
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Runtime:** Node.js
* **Runner:** `tsx` for direct execution

## Project Structure

Problem are organized in folders that replicate neetcode 150 path structure.  
Each problem has...
* It's own typescript file with a comment to the problem description at the top.
* An explanation markdown of the solution.
